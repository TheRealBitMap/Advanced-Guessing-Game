# GuessingGame
To Allow for the Guessing game  to work, you must put X.jpg inside the same folder as the main python fine, and you must change the repository inside the code FOR where the picture is. You also must install Tkinter to run this, as the TKinter module allows for the graphics to work. Otherwise, the program will fail.
